- Vertex AIによるMLOps導入

### Time

45 min

### Target audience and level

Data analysts, data scientists and DevOps engineers. Intermediate level

### Agenda

The hardest part of ML adoption in enterprises is Productinization. As we see in recent discussions around MLOps, there is a big gap between Data Scientists' PoC code and production ML development and operation with the Ops team. Such as, preparing a manageable ML dev environment, building a scalable ML serving infrastructure, setting up a ML pipeline for continuous training, managing features in a scalable way, and monitoring the model performance in the production. In this session, we will learn how to leverage various Google's MLOps best practices and Vertex AI products to solve these problems.
